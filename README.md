# tautomata
Terminal Cellular Automata

Just some fun little scripts with the following goals:

 - Implement cellular automata in a terminal
 - Require nothing that isn't usually installed by default


## Scripts

### automata.py
Library that implments the automataBoard and automata classes.  The goal is to make it where all you have to do is define your cell states and create an iterate function that accepts the board in one state and returns the board in the next generation state.


### colortest.py
Just a script to spit out the terminal colors with numbers.  So you can choose colors in the configs of each script.
